  description: 'Algorithms are a fascinating use case for visualization. To visualize
    an algorithm, we don&rsquo;t merely fit data to a chart; there is no primary dataset.
    Instead there are logical rules that describe behavior. This may be why algorithm
    visualizations are so unusual, as designers experiment with novel forms to better
    communicate. This is reason enough to study them. But algorithms are also a reminder
    that visualization is more than a tool for finding patterns in data. Visualization
    leverages the human visual system to augment human intellect: we can use it to
    better understand these important abstract processes, and perhaps other things,
    too.'
